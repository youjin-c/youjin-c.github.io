# Final Proposal

#  _AI created Public Service Advertising_

  
Based on PSA Ads phrases, we want to show how sly the border of public good
and propaganda.  
  
We will collect PSA Ads phrases and statements of controversial politicians,
and generate sentences from them. We hope those sentences gives feeling that
the phrases sounds right, but also could be manipulated for political
purposes.  
  
For implementation for the idea, we will post the printed ads in public
spaces.

# _YOLO to WebVR_

  
We want to convert 2D photos to 3D scene. After users upload their photos, we
will detect the objects from the photos and the size of them, and generated 3D
scene and arrange their position from the persons view.
